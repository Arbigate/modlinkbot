This (forced) update was \n free for all Skyrim Special Edition owners \n 2. A new DLC. This Anniversary Edition Upgrade (different from the update) was \n 20$ on Steam and acted as a fourth DLC. It included all previously released Creation \n Club content. \n \n As with any Skyrim update, the Script Extender broke.

However, \n considering how many changes occurred with AE, __any not-yet-updated SKSE mod \n that uses a DLL plugin will be broken__.
